    <h2>How Did It Form?</h2>
    <p>The start of the Universe caused the Sun to form. And the pieces of the Sun that was left to orbit it. Then gradually form planets. At that time the Earth was just a magma ball. Then slowly it cooled down and formed a habitable planet</p>

    <h2>How Did Its Moon Form?</h2>
    <p>The moon of the Earth is something we see every night except the night of New Moon(Amavasya). We wonder how it formed and what it is. Mainly, how it formed. For that the answer we have to learn from the scientists' know about the moon. Scientists say that a planet name"Theia" crashed into the Earth creating pieces and scraps of parts of the Earth. This slowly created the moon that we see night.</p>
